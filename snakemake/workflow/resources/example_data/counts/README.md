# Introduction of OSR from COUNT input
If users have a gene count-table, they can use this to perform quick DESeq2, GSEA analysis and visualizaiton of RNASeq data.
It makes it easy to add/drop samples from a gene level analysis by adding/dropping samples from the COUNT-table, meta.xlsx, and contrast.de.xlsx.

# Description of count-table format 
Three different formats of count table are supported

1. osrCount format (recommended)
    - e.g. example_data/counts/mouse.osrCount.xlsx
    - an xlsx file generated by OneStopRNASeq(OSR) as DESeq2/COUNT.xlsx
    - You can use it as is. No need to modify anything. No need to change the file name or format
    - designed to re-run gene-level analysis with updated meta-data/contrast info quickly

2. cleanCount format (recommended)
    - e.g. example_data/counts/cleanCount.mouse.xlsx
    - an xlsx file that has gene-name or gene-id as the first column, and read counts in other columns
    - table header must be: Gene    SampleName1 SampleName2 etc.
    - because no concatenated exon length (Gene length) is provided, TPM/FPKM normalization will not be performed, and DESeq2 normalized expression values will be used in the output tables instead
    - minimum information required from users, designed to run OSR analysis with count-table generated with any software, so that users have more flexibility

3. featureCounts format (use with caution, Excel does not work well on txt files)
    - e.g. example_data/counts/featureCounts.mouse.txt
    - a txt file generate by featureCounts software
    - table header must be exactly:    Geneid	Chr	Start	End	Strand	Length	SampleName1 SampleName2 etc.
    - the seperator of columns must be 'tab'
    - designed to run OSR analysis with any featureCounts count-table obtained from collaborators, public database, etc.
    - when using Excel to edit this file, please be sure to delete the comment line from featureCount (e.g. # Program:featureCounts v2.0.0; Command:""featureCounts""...)

# Description of meta-data file:
    - e.g. example_data/meta/meta.xlsx
    - an xlsx file that describes each sample
    - must have the following header: SAMPLE_LABEL GROUP_LABEL BATCH
    - sample labels in meta-data and count-table must be exactly the same, any typo, or missing/additional sample labels in meta-data will stop the analysis 

# Description of contrast file:
    - e.g.  example_data/meta/contrast.de.xlsx
    - an xlsx file that describes the comparison/contrast of groups that is of research interest
    - all GROUPS listed must be included in the GROUP_LABEL column of meta-data file, typos will stop the analysis or give wrong results
    - if you are interested in combining multiple GROUPS in the comparison, please use semicolon to seperate them
    - results will be the comparison of row2-GROUP vs row3-GROUP
